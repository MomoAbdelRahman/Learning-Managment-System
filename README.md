# Learning Managment System

Users @[YoussefMAllam](https://github.com/YoussefMAllam), @[amltarek](https://github.com/amltarek), and I collaborated in this project to create a fully functional learning managment system using SQL Server and ASP.NET for the course CIE 205 Database Managment System offered in Zewail City of Science and Technology.
The website integrates with a database on the primary server which includes login information for users which are divided into students and instructors. The only user that can create/delete users is the admin. Students
can access all the material for their courses including their assignments, and they can submit their assignments which then appear for the instructor where he can grade them and upload the grade. A further feature, is a forum which can be 
accessed by both students and instructors for further discussions. There are many other features included in the LMS which you can check out.
